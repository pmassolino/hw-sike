The design was made in hardware/software co-design. The main CPU was made exclusively for this design, together with the multiplier accumulator co-processor called Carmela. There are two Carmela versions, one with a 128 bits multiplier and another with a 256 bits multiplier. Because there are two Carmela versions, there are two versions of the system, sike_core_v256 and sike_core_v128.

All the code that was created for this design is in public domain.
There are codes that have been used in this project, that have a different license, such as the ones in Xilinx project folders and the Keccak code.

All the Keccak VHDL code was obtained from:

+ Guido Bertoni, Joan Daemen, MichaÃ«l Peeters, and Gilles Van Assche. [Keccak in VHDL](https://keccak.team/hardware.html). 2012. https://keccak.team/hardware.html

And the SHA3/Keccak Python code was obtained from:

#### GHDL remarks

If you are going to use the GHDL to simulate this project, you have to change the file synth_double_ram.vhd
In the file there are two architectures : behavioral and vivado_behavioral. When performing GHDL simulations you have comment "vivado_behavioral" and use the "behavioral", and when you use Vivado or ISE to synthesize, you use the "vivado_behavioral".
